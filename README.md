# GDG-App-Core
Core repository for the GDG Application, containing resources and documentation.
Please feel free to open a PR or issue.


## Why, what, how:

The aim of the project is to create an app for the Local and Global GDG Communities - a place where they can talk, connect, help each other grow and learn.  The bigger, more important goal is to learn through doing and create resources for everyone else to do the same.

### Stack:

*Mobile app:*
* Flutter

*Backend*
* Ktor
* Firebase:
	* Auth
	* Firestore
	* Cloud messaging
	* Analytics
* Google  Cloud (AppEngine)


### Project flow:

The project will be split into multiple workshops, probably
switching between technologies so we don’t work without an API.

Workshops will consist at first of “codelab” style technology introduction after which the users will split into groups and claim features which they want to contribute to until or during the next workshop. Next workshops will consist of talks in which you can show us what you made, brag how you made it, or prepare others for the task at hand and then we can all work together on features, discuss them or help each on problems we encounter 

The contributors will create PR’s on repositories which will be hosted on GDG Zagreb’s GitHub and open for everyone to see.
